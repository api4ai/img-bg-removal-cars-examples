# API4AI car image background removal

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI Car Image Background Removal API.
The sample is implemented in `bash` using `curl` command-line tool.


## Overview

This API provides segmentation photos of cars with consequent background removal.


## Getting started

Try sample with default args:

```bash
bash sample.sh

Try sample with your local image:

```

Try sample and parse with `jq` tool (note: you may need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) separately) for pretty formatted output:

```bash

```
